WIP: Common plotting recipes for statistics and machine learning.

This package uses [Plots.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl) to provide high-level statistical plotting
tools which are independent of both the platform and graphical library.

See the issues for a TODO list.  Collaboration is very welcome.
